## üìã Project Overview

In a world of ambitious projects and tight deadlines, the hardest part is often getting started. Momentum Planner tackles this initial inertia by bridging the gap between a high-level goal and a concrete, step-by-step plan. Users can simply describe their objective, and the AI will generate a comprehensive project timeline, complete with phases, priorities, and dependencies, turning overwhelming goals into manageable tasks.
